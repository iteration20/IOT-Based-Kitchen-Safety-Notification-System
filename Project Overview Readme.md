# IOT-Based-Kitchen-Safety-Notification-System
Academic Freelancing Project taken as an Instructor. The purpose of this project was to build a kitchen safety and security system with notification alarm.

It was an ESP8266-based smart kitchen with automation and an ESP-DASH monitoring system. The principal objective of this project is to create a web-based prototype of an ESP8266-based smart kitchen monitoring and automation system. Several sensors, relays, and NodeMCU ESP8266 boards are used in the system. On the online dashboard, we can view all sensor data visually. The webserver can also send commands to operate kitchen appliances.
